# CityGML 3D Metadata ADE

CityGML extension for modelling metadata related to 3D city models.
This ADE contains ISO 19115 compliant elements dervied from the *Metadata for the discovery of geographic datasets and series* table (Table F.1 in the ISO 19115:2014 documentation).
This ADE also contains 3D specific information such as the levels of details, thematic models, semantics, textures, materials and process of model aquisition. 


# Resources

The **UML model** of the 3D Metadata ADE was created using Enterprise Architect.  
- This [Enterprise Architect file](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3D_Metadata_ADE/blob/master/UML/CityGML_3DMD_ADE_0_2.eap) contains the UML model.
- The UML diagrams can be downloaded in [PDF format](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3D_Metadata_ADE/blob/master/UML/UML_Diagrams.pdf) as well.

The **XML Schema files** of the 3D Metadata ADE was derived automatically from the UML model using ShapeChange(http://shapechange.net/).  
- This is the derived [XML Schema file](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3D_Metadata_ADE/blob/master/XSD/3DMD_ADE.xsd) for 3DMD ADE.
- Browsable schema for the ADE can be accessed [here](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3D_Metadata_ADE/tree/master/Documentation/BrowsableSchema).
- Codelists can be accessed here [Codelists](https://github.com/tudelft3d/3D_Metadata_ADE/tree/master/XSD/codelists).
# More information

[OGC CityGML](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/citygml) is an XML based data model for the storage and exchange of virtual 3D city models. It is implemented an application schema of GML3 [Geography Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml). The data model of CityGML comprises of a core module and several thematic extension modules like Building, Relief, Bridge, LandUse, Tunnel, Transportation, Vegetation, WaterBody, etc for representing 3D city models.
